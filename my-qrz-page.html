      <h3>Current Happenings</h3>

      <ul>
	<li>Lately I have getting back into CW lately, which has been a blast. I'm working on getting my speed up, but it's a slow process. <strong>SKCC: #25592</strong></li>
	<li>With the above - I've also been getting into POTA and doing CW POTA activations.</li>
	<li>Been getting into contesting more which is a new aspect of the hobby for me. Shout out to K5TR for being an awesome elmer on that.</li>
	<li>I maintain a few repeaters and nodes around Austin, and upkeep on those keeps me busy!</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Shack Gear</h4>

      <p>
        My shack is shared with my living room and computer working area in my (small) apartment in South Central Austin. I have another small desk that is used as a small test bench and soldering station for projects. My shack currently consists of the following in no particular order:
      </p>

      <table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
	<tbody>
	  <tr>
	    <td><strong>Icom IC-7300</strong></td>
	    <td>
	      <p>Primary HF and 6m radio.</p>

	      <ul>
		<li>For CW, I have a &quot;squid&quot; connected to the key input of the radio, which then connects the following keys:
		  <ul>
		    <li>(Straight Key) Japanese Aircraft Hand Spark Key Circa 1940 (2 terminal version)</li>
		    <li>(Bug) Electric Specialty Manufacturing (I don't know much about it, unfortunately)</li>
		    <li>(Paddle) Bencher connected to an Open CW Keyer Mk2</li>
		    <li>(PC) The radio can also be keyed for CW by my computer using standard DTR serial switching</li>
		  </ul>
		</li>
		<li>For SSB, I use an RE320 microphone into an XR16 mixer. One of the aux outs on the mixer goes to the 7300's mic jack using a Heil cable which also connects to a Heil footswitch.</li>
		<li>For digital, the radio connects via USB to my desktop.</li>

      <h4>Antennas</h4>

      Getting on the air in an apartment setting can be somewhat interesting. My apartment complex has been nice enough to let me have antennas on the balconies. This section describes what I have. The HF antennas (the mag loop, Ultimax, 40m isotron, and OA-50 6m) feed into a relay box which is remotely controllable via a remote coax switch box that sits in the shack.

      <ul>
	<li><strong>MFJ 1782 Mag Loop</strong> - This is my <strong>main HF</strong> antenna. It's mounted horizontally on the back balcony railing and gets me on 10m down through 30m. It comes with a loop controller box that lets me tune it as I tune around the HF bands.</li>
	<li><strong>Ultimax 100 80m-6m end fed</strong> - hung vertically down from my balcony and discretely against the building - secondary HF antenna, and access to 40m, 60m, 80m.</li>
	<li><strong>40m isotron</strong> - picks up a lot of noise, so I don't use it as much as the Ultimax for 40m, but it's a good backup.</li>
	<li><strong>Comet GP-1</strong> - 2/440 antenna, vertical (currently unused).</li>
	<li><strong>220 MHz J-Pole</strong> - Vertical, copper tubing. Bought on eBay. Just used to get into <strong>local 220 repeaters</strong> such as AI5A/R downtown.</li>
	<li><strong>Comet KP-20</strong> - 900MHz antenna, 8ft, vertical, used for the <strong>927.9750 simplex node</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>6m PAR OA-50</strong> - Omni-angle horizontal 6m antenna; used for <strong>FT8</strong> and to talk to locals on &quot;<strong>6 meter monday</strong>&quot; nets.</li>
	<li><strong>Diamond X-50A</strong> - Vertical, used for both the <strong>441.350 repeater</strong> and the <strong>AI5A-1 digipeater</strong> via a diplexer.</li>
	<li><strong>Diamond X-30A</strong> - Front balcony, vertical. My <strong>primary VHF/UHF</strong> FM antenna.</li>
	<li><strong>Custom-made 220 Ground Plane</strong> - inside, in a closet; it actually resonates reasonably well on UHF as well, and I am currently using it to get into the local DMR repeater. I only push 1W into it, usually.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Hey, I'm Rick. I was initially licensed in 2004 at the age of 13, studying with my father who was battling a plethora of health issues at the time. Although he never became licensed, I ended up passing my Technician class license just days after he passed away and was granted my original callsign, KB3LLM, on 3 September 2004. The local ham radio community provided me a group of friends to fall back on during difficult times. I ended up passing my 5 WPM code test (effectively granting me &quot;technician plus&quot; privileges), though I didn't pass my general written exam until after the code requirement was removed.</p>

      <p>Several months after my dad passed, my mom and I moved to Ohio. I largely put ham radio aside at that point and focused on school, learning programming, and taking up various other hobbies along the way. I graduated high school in 2010 and began pursuing a degree at the University of Akron. I got back into ham radio through the University's amateur radio club (W8UPD), and quickly made some friends with whom I remain in contact to this day.</p>

      <p>Although I was active in the club, I didn't operate much from home. I occasionally operated the club station in Zook Hall room 501 and was active in various club projects, but all-in-all I didn't get on the air all that often. Fast-forwarding a bit, I ultimately graduated from Youngstown State University in Youngstown, Ohio, in 2019 and moved to Austin, TX where I reside now.</p>

      <p>During the COVID pandemic, I found ham radio a third time. I googled for local clubs and found my new home: The Oak Hill Amateur Radio Club (OHARC/N5OAK). Through this club I have met many super smart and supportive people. I started piecing together a shack and attended Summer Field Day 2021 with the club.</p>

      <p>Since then, I've put up two repeaters in the Austin area, along with a digipeater. I built up an apartment shack to get me on 80m up through 900MHz, participated in fox hunts, and generally been active in various capacities on the air. I am currently working on improving both my CW and contesting skills.</p>

      <p>When I'm not on the air, other hobbies include swing dancing, computer programming, electronics dabbling, audio engineering, studying historical linguistics, studying pure mathematics, and the occasional video game.</p>

      <p>I'm very much an advocate of open source software.</p>
